    <p class="lead">As anyone who has floated, fished, hiked or otherwise explored the John Day River will quickly tell you, this is a special place. For boaters, the John Day is a meandering, multi-day float through deep basalt canyons in the company of bighorn sheep and grasshopper sparrows, where big summer moons light up wide open skies. For anglers, it's a steelhead paradise, home to the healthiest run of wild summer fish in the Columbia Basin.</p>

    <p>For Western Rivers Conservancy, the John Day has meant opportunity—our chance to conserve a vast expanse of rare shrub-steppe habitat and protect 16 miles along both banks of the longest free-flowing river in the Pacific Northwest. And for Oregon, it means a new state park: Cottonwood Canyon, Oregon's largest park in a generation.</p>

    <p>This historic conservation project began in 2008 when WRC purchased Murtha Ranch, a former cattle ranch with 16,000 acres of deeded and leased lands along the lower John Day. The land included the lower three miles of Hay Creek, a rare cold-water spawning and rearing tributary on the lower river.
</p>

    <p>By acquiring the ranch, WRC was able to ensure the long-term health of a large part of the lower John Day and an expansive sweep of native grassland. For the shrub-steppe ecosystem, which is rapidly disappearing from the West, this is a critical accomplishment.</p>

    <p>Oregon Parks and Recreation Department, which will maintain the park as a wild and rugged alternative to more developed state parks, has been the perfect partner in this project. Its long-term management plan meets our vision of creating a sanctuary for fish and wildlife, where rare species like burrowing owls and sagebrush lizards can survive—and where people can escape to rejuvenate themselves in a setting that is quiet, peaceful and wild.</p>

    <h4>Accomplishments</h4>
    <p>Following completion of a three-year effort to conserve 16,000 acres along the John Day, WRC spent much of 2012 restoring three miles of Hay Creek and five miles along the main-stem in anticipation of the grand opening of Cottonwood Canyon State Park.</p>
