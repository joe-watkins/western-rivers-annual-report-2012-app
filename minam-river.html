    <p class="lead">Rising from a glacial cirque at 7,700 feet in Oregon's Wallowa Mountains, the Minam River flows 51 miles through remote, rugged country before joining the Wallowa River, a major tributary of the Grande Ronde. The Minam's entire length, from its headwaters in the Eagle Cap Wilderness to the Wallowa, is an Oregon State Scenic Waterway. All but its lower eight miles are also a federally designated Wild and Scenic River.</p>

    <p>Each year, thousands of people make their way to the Minam. Hikers, anglers, hunters and backpackers wander up the Minam River Trail, and kayakers and rafters from all over head to their favorite put-ins. For decades, a primary access point for this outdoor playground has been the historic Minam Store, located at the confluence of the Minam and Wallowa Rivers.</p>

    <p>In 2012, Western Rivers Conservancy conveyed two acres and 350 feet of Wallowa River frontage, including the Minam Store, to Oregon Parks and Recreation Department to ensure the Minam Store property remains forever open to the public. Like the Minam River itself, the store is widely loved and equally deserving of protection. It is now part of the 605-acre Minam State Recreation Area.</p>

        <h4>Accomplishments</h4>
        <p>WRC expanded the Minam State Recreation Area and guaranteed permanent boating and fishing access at the confluence of the Minam and Wallowa Rivers when it conveyed a small but important property on the banks of the Minam to Oregon Parks and Recreation Department.</p>
