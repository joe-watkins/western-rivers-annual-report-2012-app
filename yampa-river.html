    <p class="lead">In 2012, Western Rivers Conservancy completed a historic purchase on Colorado's Yampa River: Cross Mountain Canyon Ranch. The acquisition creates a sanctuary for four species of native warm-water fish, protects 2.5 miles of riverlands and opens new public access to the surrounding Cross Mountain Wilderness Study Area. For WRC and the West, acquisition of the ranch is a milestone in terms of both access and river conservation.</p>

    <p>The least dammed river in the Colorado Basin, the Yampa flows 250 miles from the Flat Tops Wilderness to the Green River, in Dinosaur National Monument. Along the way, it nourishes one of the finest riparian corridors in the West, including extensive cottonwood forests along the middle and lower river. The lower Yampa is home to elk, bighorn sheep, antelope, mountain lion, coyote, mule deer, beaver, peregrine falcon and numerous songbird species. It is also home to all four species of imperiled Colorado Basin warm-water fish: razorback sucker, humpback chub, bonytail chub and, tipping scales at up to 80 pounds, Colorado pikeminnow.</p>

    <p>The 920-acre parcel lies west of Maybell, Colorado, at the entrance to a spectacular vertical-walled gorge known as Cross Mountain Canyon. It is also strategically located on the eastern edge of the Cross Mountain Wilderness Study Area, which is home to one of the largest migratory elk herds in North America. Despite being one of the country's most fabled big-game hunting grounds, the area had been effectively off limits to the public because access was strictly through private property or by boat. With WRC's purchase of Cross Mountain Canyon Ranch, it is now open to all.</p>

    <p>Because of the ranch's location, the Bureau of Land Management has wanted to acquire the property for years. To make that vision a reality, WRC worked with the BLM throughout 2012 with the goal of conveying the property to the agency for permanent stewardship. Compatible access is integral to WRC's mission, and we are thrilled about enabling the public to acquire a property that not only protects a great river, but creates new access to an invaluable natural resource.</p>
