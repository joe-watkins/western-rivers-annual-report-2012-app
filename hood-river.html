    <p class="lead">With its headwaters in the glaciers of Oregon's highest peak, the Hood River flows wild and clean down the flanks of Mount Hood to its confluence with the Columbia River. It's a lively stream, with icy waters that nourish the most diverse assemblage of salmon and steelhead species in the lower Columbia River Basin. From the towns of Hood River, Portland and The Dalles, people flock to the Hood for summer swimming, winter fishing and year-round hiking.</p>

    <p>In 2010, the utility PacifiCorp removed Powerdale Dam on the lower river, making this spectacular stream entirely free-flowing for the first time in nearly 90 years. In the wake of this remarkable transition, Western Rivers Conservancy purchased an area of riverlands surrounding one of the finest parts of the entire Hood River system: the confluence of the East and West forks and Punch Bowl Falls.</p>

    <p>Throughout 2012, WRC continued its work to establish a major sanctuary for fish, wildlife and people in this special location, which has been sacred to Native Americans for thousands of years. When the project is complete, Hood River County will protect both the confluence and the Falls, along with the abundance of salmon, steelhead and trout the river sustains.</p>

        <h4>Accomplishments</h4>
        <p>Last year, WRC continued working to establish a sanctuary for fish, wildlife and people at the confluence of the East and West forks of the Hood River. Once complete, the project will forever conserve Punch Bowl Falls and key wildlife habitat on one of the Cascades' most diverse fisheries.</p>
