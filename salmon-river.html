    <p class="lead">In one of the longest anadromous journeys on earth, salmon and steelhead return to the Salmon River each year to spawn. Once they leave the Pacific, their epic swim spans more than 900 miles and eight dams, reaching elevations well over 7,000 feet. Once these fish reach the Salmon, they are home free. No other dam will impede their migration. Except for a small weir high in the river's headwaters, the Salmon River is entirely free of dams—all 425 miles of it.</p>

    <p>Idaho's landmark river is one of the West's great waterways. In free-flowing length alone, it surpasses nearly every other stream in the region. Because of the river's rugged isolation, it is also one of Idaho's premier outdoor destinations, attracting some 600,000 outdoor enthusiasts every year, including boaters, anglers, hunters, hikers and equestrians.</p>

    <p>On the lower river, near the town of Grangeville, lies the Bureau of Land Management's Pine Bar Recreation Site, a popular boating access and campground on the Salmon. Surrounding this recreational area is a 1,284-acre piece of property that, in 2012, Western Rivers Conservancy committed to purchase.</p>

    <p>Conservation of this property will protect six cold, high-gradient tributaries that flow into the Salmon River and directly influence habitat quality for five ESA-listed fish, including sockeye and Chinook salmon, steelhead and migratory bull trout. WRC's efforts will also conserve prime habitat for mountain lion and black bear, as well as key winter range for Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep, mule deer, Rocky Mountain elk and white-tailed deer.</p>

    <p>This is WRC's first project on the Salmon River. We are excited to play a new and important role in conserving a stream that is not only one of our own favorite playgrounds, but a treasure for so many others.</p>

    <h4>Accomplishments</h4>
    <p>Committing to an important land purchase on Idaho's Salmon River, WRC took the first major step toward conserving key habitat for five ESA-listed fish, including Chinook, steelhead and bull trout. Acquisition will also protect habitat for mountain lion, black bear, Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep and Rocky Mountain elk.</p>
