    <p class="lead">Western Rivers Conservancy has forever safeguarded the last unprotected stretch of Northern California's beautiful Deer Creek, chalking up a conservation victory for both salmon and people. Deer Creek, which flows from the flanks of Mount Lassen to the Sacramento River, is one of the few streams left in the Sierra Nevada that holds healthy runs of spring Chinook salmon and steelhead. The project lands encompass 600 acres centered at Lower Deer Creek Falls. The falls themselves are treasured by hikers, and the area is prized by whitewater kayakers.</p>

    <p>The upper reaches of Deer Creek flow through old-growth forests that are prime habitat for California spotted owl, black bear and other wildlife. The river tumbles through a deepening volcanic canyon, then courses through chaparral forests and groves of blue oaks before meeting the Sacramento. Along the middle stretch, where you will find Lower Deer Creek Falls, the river is easily accessible to hikers via Highway 32. A trail winds through the canyon, leads to the falls and then connects to a network of wilderness trails.</p>

    <p>Although at 50 miles Deer Creek is a relatively small stream, it's of great importance when it comes to salmon survival in California. The river lacks dams, is nearly void of development and has little watershed disturbance. It is one of the Sierra's top three streams in regard to healthy conditions for aquatic life. For California salmon and steelhead, Deer Creek holds one of their best chances of survival.</p>

    <p>For this reason, WRC seized the opportunity to purchase this inholding within Lassen National Forest from Sierra Pacific Industries in 2009. Last year, we conveyed the property to the Northern California Regional Land Trust with funding from the California Wildlife Conservation Board. The Trust will hold the land in permanent protection for the benefit of wildlife, people and Deer Creek's salmon and steelhead.</p>
