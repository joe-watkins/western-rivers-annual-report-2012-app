    <p class="lead">Colorado's Little Cimarron River tumbles out of the Uncompahgre Wilderness high in the Rocky Mountains. It flows for 25 miles before joining the main-stem Cimarron, which meets the Gunnison River at the spectacular Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park. The Little Cimarron's upper reaches are prime trout water. The lower river, however, where it passes through the agricultural Pleasant Valley, is de-watered much of the year.</p>

    <p>When a strategically located farm in the Pleasant Valley went into bank foreclosure, WRC, working with Colorado Water Trust (CWT), recognized a unique opportunity to put water back in the Little Cimarron. The property possesses senior water rights on a major irrigation ditch—enough water to potentially keep the Little Cimarron flowing year-round if kept in the river. In 2012, WRC stepped in and purchased the farm. We are now working in partnership with CWT and Colorado Open Lands to conserve the farmland and dedicate the farm's water as “in-stream” during the driest months of the year.</p>

    <p>Our goal is to reestablish perennial flows, reconnect vital fish habitat, reduce river temperatures and allow trout to repopulate the formerly de-watered reach of the stream. For WRC this will be a another example of how strategic land acquisition can be the most effective way to conserve a river—forever.</p>

        <p>WRC took the first steps toward reconnecting prime trout habitat on a key Gunnison River tributary, the Little Cimarron, when it purchased a former dairy farm above this Colorado stream.</p>
