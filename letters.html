          <p>Each year, our staff and Board get together on a river we love, on a stream like the Salmon, the Rogue or the North Fork Flathead. We turn off the cell phones, load the rafts and push off on a multi-day float. We eat, drink, take turns at the oars, swim, joke and replenish ourselves on the sounds and sensations of a flowing river and remote wilderness scenery.</p>

          <p>It's on these annual trips that we realize together, once again, precisely why we do what we do. Rivers are life. This is true not just for the plants and animals that depend on them, but for us—all of us. I know that as a supporter of Western Rivers Conservancy, you also care deeply about our streams.</p>

          <p>I am proud to say that we have some of the best, most important projects in WRC history on our plate today. Last year, some of these projects were launched, others were carried forward and some were completed, meaning the riverlands you helped us purchase are being conserved for fish, wildlife and people forever.</p>

          <p>I hope you enjoy reading about the work we accomplished in 2012. With your support we are taking riverland acquisition to new levels and protecting even more of the great rivers of the West, streams that nourish our lives and keep our communities, our countryside and our country healthy and alive.</p>

          <p>For our rivers,<br>
          <strong>Sue Doroff</strong><br>

          <p>On the surface, saving a river through land acquisition is straightforward stuff: identify and purchase an important property on an outstanding river and convey it to a long-term conservation steward for permanent protection. While our results are ultimately always the same—with each project, a river is protected forever—it's the getting there that always differs. The process is anything but straightforward.</p>

          <p>At its core, riverland acquisition requires innovation, partnership, creativity, relationship-building and trust. It requires intimate knowledge of conservation finance, carbon sequestration and new markets tax credits. It requires science, stream ecology and a passion for rivers. Most of all, it requires support from our community. Whether you've been with us for a year or two decades, you have helped place Western Rivers Conservancy at the forefront of what we do, making us the West's most effective organization when it comes to riverland conservation. We thank you for it. And we're sure that, generations from now, our children will thank you for it, too.</p>

          <p>Warmest regards,<br>
            <strong>Nan McKay</strong><br>
            Board Chair</p>
