    <p class="lead">On Northern California's remote Redwood Coast, a stream called Blue Creek flows cold and clear from the Siskiyou Mountains. It meets the Klamath River 16 miles upstream from the Pacific, injecting the Klamath with a life-giving dose of clean, cold water. When the Klamath is stressed by low flows and warm temperatures, Blue Creek becomes the lower river's most important cold-water refuge for returning salmon and steelhead. Nearly every one of these fish holds in Blue Creek, lowering its body temperature by an average of eight degrees. Without this cool-down period, most salmon and steelhead would likely die before reaching their spawning grounds upstream.</p>

    <p>To keep Blue Creek healthy and cold, Western Rivers Conservancy formed a landmark partnership with California's Yurok Tribe to help the Tribe purchase over 47,000 acres of ancestral homelands along the Klamath, including the entire lower Blue Creek watershed. (The upper watershed is already protected by the Siskiyou Wilderness Area.) When the project is complete, a 15,000-acre salmon sanctuary will protect Blue Creek, and California's largest Native American tribe will regain a vast ancestral homeland.</p>

    <p>To date, WRC has helped the Yurok purchase over 22,000 acres of maturing riverland forest from Green Diamond Resource Company. The land is now the Yurok Tribal Community Forest and will be sustainably managed for clean water, fish habitat, forest health and cultural rejuvenation. Throughout 2012, WRC continued working with Green Diamond and the Yurok to facilitate purchase of the remaining 25,000 acres.</p>

    <p>This second stage is the heart of our conservation effort on the Klamath. It will help ensure the river remains cold enough to sustain its surviving runs of anadromous fish while efforts are under way to remove upstream dams and restore the river to health. Home to coho, Chinook, steelhead, coastal cutthroat trout and green sturgeon, the Klamath once had the second largest runs of salmon on the entire West Coast. These runs remain some of the largest in the West, and they are by far the most restorable.</p>

    <p>Adding to the importance of WRC's effort, the project will also protect an expansive tract of forest in one of the most biologically diverse regions on the planet. The Klamath-Siskiyou is home to a rich assemblage of rare plants and animals, and this acquisition will improve and protect habitat for rare species like Humboldt marten, northern spotted owl, California condor and marbled murrelet.</p>

    <h4>Accomplishments</h4>
    <p>Throughout 2012, WRC continued its work to create a major salmon sanctuary and Tribal forest preserve on California's Klamath River. After purchasing 22,237 acres along the main-stem Klamath in 2011, WRC focused last year on acquiring an additional 24,860 acres along and around Blue Creek, a major cold-water tributary.</p>
