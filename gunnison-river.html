    <p class="lead">Carving away at the Colorado Plateau for more than two million years, the Gunnison River is one of the West's great geologic sculptors. The upper river flows through some of the country's deepest gorges, including the 2,800-foot-deep Black Canyon of the Gunnison. As the river winds its way down into the juniper and scrub oak forests of the Uncompahgre Plateau, it gradually widens and slows. Yet it continues its erosive effect on the landscape, carving surreal shapes into the sandstone cliffs just as it has for millennia.</p>

    <p>Before its confluence with the Colorado River, the lower Gunnison passes through the Dominguez-Escalante National Conservation Area (DENCA), the Dominguez Canyon Wilderness Area and the Bangs Canyon Special Recreation Management Area. Scenic canyons and sandstone mesas dominate the landscape, and the area is home to desert bighorn sheep, mountain lion, black bear, river otter, bald eagle and Rocky Mountain elk. Four rare species of Colorado Basin warm-water fish, including the razorback sucker and the Colorado pikeminnow, inhabit the river. The DENCA is also rich in archeological sites, including prehistoric trails and rock art sites. Remote and spectacular, the area offers exceptional hiking, wildlife viewing and boating opportunities.</p>

    <p>Despite the area's extraordinary natural and recreational merits, more than 16 miles of the river within the DENCA are privately owned, and some face the threat of development or gravel mining. With the goal of removing these threats forever, Western Rivers Conservancy has been working to purchase inholdings along the Gunnison since 2008.</p>

    <p>In 2012, we conveyed a strategically located property to the Bureau of Land Management, preventing a gravel mine on the banks of the Gunnison at the northern entrance of the DENCA. We consider this project a tremendous conservation accomplishment not just for Coloradans, but for fish, wildlife and anyone who ventures out to explore this remote and outstanding western river.</p>

    <h4>Accomplishments</h4>
    <p>WRC forever protected access to the northern end of the Dominguez-Escalante National Conservation Area by conveying a strategically located property on the Gunnison River to the Bureau of Land Management. Our efforts also prevented a gravel mine on the banks of the river.</p>
