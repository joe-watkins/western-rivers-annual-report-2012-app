    <p class="lead">In 2012, Western Rivers Conservancy (WRC) and its partners Portland General Electric (PGE) and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) completed a landmark conservation project on Oregon's magnificent Sandy River. Today, Oregonians can take pride in a conservation and recreation corridor that spans over 17 spectacular miles along the Sandy, Little Sandy and Bull Run riversâ€”all within 25 miles of downtown Portland.</p>

    <p>The Sandy River project encompasses a total of 3,984 acres and includes the last significant stand of old-growth riparian forest in the middle Sandy River Basin. Roosevelt elk, black-tailed deer, mountain lion and black bear all reside within the corridor, while coho Chinook, steelhead and coastal cutthroat trout spawn healthily in all three rivers. Conservation of these lands creates a sanctuary for fish and wildlife and an unmatched outdoor playground in Portland's backyard.</p>

    <p>WRC's work on the Sandy began in 1999 when we partnered with PGE to restore the Sandy and Little Sandy rivers to health, an effort that included PGE's removal of two dams in 2007 and 2008. The BLM committed to protect and manage the conservation lands from the outset. For the BLM, this was an unprecedented project because of its proximity to an urban area. That very characteristic soon made it the agency's number one national priority. The opportunity to create and manage an Area of Critical Environmental Concern on the doorstep of a major metropolitan area was extraordinary.</p>

    <p>Above and below the project area, parks and wilderness safeguard much of the rest of the river, which means nearly all of the Sandy's 56 miles are now protected for fish, wildlife and public enjoyment. We are proud to have played this role in making the Sandy River wilder and freer than ever, and proud to work with PGE and the BLM to give Oregonians a riverland jewel that will be cherished for generations.</p>
